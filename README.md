### Welcome! I am a student working on a bachelor's degree in computer science with the goal of becoming a software engineer.

### Here is some information about me and this page:

Languages:
- Python
- x86 Assembly Language (with MASM as assembler)
- Javascript
- HTML
- Java

Notable Projects:
- Battleship Game (Python): This program contains a class called ShipGame that allows two people to play the game Battleship. Each
  player has their own 10x10 grid they place their ships on. On their turn, they can fire a torpedo at a
  square on the enemy's grid. Player 'first' gets the first turn to fire a torpedo, after which players
  alternate firing torpedos. A ship is sunk when all of its squares have been hit. When a player sinks their
  opponent's final ship, they win.
